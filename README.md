# Debug Paste Frontend

This is the frontend used by [@EldoriaRPG](https://github.com/eldoriarpg) for their debug pastes.

This frontend is based on TailwindCSS v2+. The repository is very minimalistic and only contains the bare minimum.

## Setup and Build Project

The project needs a few dependencies.  
To install them you can use `npm install` in the root of this project.  
After that you can build a dev version of the used css file with `npm run dev`.   
If you want to build a production version of the css file, use `npm run build`.
